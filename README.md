📈 Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict future stock prices using historical data and machine learning algorithms. By analyzing patterns and trends in past stock market data, the model provides insights into potential future movements, assisting investors and analysts in making informed decisions.

🔍 Features
Clean and preprocess historical stock market data (Yahoo Finance / CSV)

Visualize stock trends using Matplotlib/Seaborn

Implement multiple ML models for price prediction:

Linear Regression

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

Random Forest Regressor

Support Vector Regressor

Evaluate model performance using RMSE and R² Score

Interactive plots for actual vs. predicted prices

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

Pandas, NumPy

scikit-learn

TensorFlow / Keras (for LSTM)

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Streamlit (optional for deployment)

📊 Sample Output
Predicted vs. Actual stock prices plotted to assess model accuracy.

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Jupyter Notebook or main.py

Optionally, launch the Streamlit app: streamlit run app.py

📂 Dataset
